This folder is a web done in php language.

To access it from a browser, a web server program such as apache, xampp, nginx, etc
is needed.

Once you have a running web server software running in your computer, put the
whole package in the correct place inside the web server (for example, the
'htdocs' folder), and then go to:

"http://localhost/waterbase-uwwtd/src/2-web/"

and the web platform that reads the sqlite database will start loading.
